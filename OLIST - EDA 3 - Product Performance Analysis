Q1. How many orders were placed on Olist, and how does this vary by month or season?

SELECT
MONTHNAME(o.order_purchase) AS mnth, COUNT(op.order_id) AS order_count
FROM
order_payments op
JOIN orders o USING(order_id)
GROUP BY
mnth
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- total orders - 103885
--top 3 months (Aug-11248,may-11079,july-10824)
 -- last 3 months(sep-4535,oct -5205,dec-5896)



Q2.  What are the most popular product categories on
 Olist BASED ON NUMBER OF ORDERS , and how do their ORDER NUMBER compare to each other?

         WITH t1 AS (SELECT
YEAR(o.order_purchase) AS year,p.product_category,
ROUND(COUNT(op.order_id),2) AS total_orders ,
DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(o.order_purchase)

DESC ) AS rk	
FROM order_payments op
JOIN orders o USING(order_id)
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id=oi.order_id

SELECT year,pt.category_translation AS category , t1.total_orders
FROM t1
JOIN product_translation pt
ON t1.product_category=pt.category
WHERE t1.rk<=5
ORDER BY year ASC ,total_orders DESC;

-- in 2016 top  and last product are (furniture decor , health beauty , perfumery  and 
 last is housewares ), 
 -- in 2017 top and last products are(bed bath table ,furniture decor ,sports leisure 
health beauty and the last is housewares ),

SELECT CTE.year,pt.category_translation,CTE.cancel_cnt
FROM CTE JOIN product_translation pt
ON CTE.category=pt.category
WHERE CTE.rk<=5
ORDER BY CTE.year,CTE.cancel_cnt DESC

 -- in 2017 sports_leisure,housewares,computer_accesories,auto,furniture_decor
 -- in 2018 health beauty,housewares,computer accesories ,sports_leisures,furniture decor



-- Numbers of orders where payment value is less than 10

SELECT

orders o USING(order_id)
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id=c.customer_id
WHERE
op.payment_value<10

city
ORDER BY
COUNT(op.order_id) DESC;

-- sao paulo i.e 288 and rio de janeiro i.e 112 had the most orders below the value of 10

FROM product_translation pt
JOIN CTE ON pt.category=CTE.product_category
ORDER BY
